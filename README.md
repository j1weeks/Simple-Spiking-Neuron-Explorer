# Simple-Spiking-Neuron-Explorer
A graphical user interface for graphing excitable neurons using the method described by Eugene Izhikevich in his paper, "Simple Model of Spiking Neurons" (2003).

This program simulates the dynamic behavior of a neuron with tunable parameters. Following a short period of rest, the user-defined input current I is applied. The membrane potential and the phase portrait are graphed with optional animations to show the relationship between the two plots over time.
